1. Download and Install Node.js: Go to the Node.js website

npm init -y

6. Install Express.js you can install Express.js for any project by running
   npm install express

Projct Strucuture :
package.json (through npm init).
node_modules/ folder (which contains installed dependencies like Express, through npm install express).
The actual folder structure (public/, images/, etc.) and the files inside them need to be manually created. This is because Node.js doesn't assume what your project structure should look like. You have to create it based on your needs.
